        <h1>This is the website of Rickie</h1>
        <p>Who is the friend of LKM</p>
        <p>Rickie would become the best scientist in the world</p>

        <h2>Archean startup project</h2>
        <p>Archean is a revolutionary technology in turning algae and blue-green alage in <br>
            food, biofuel and bioplastics. Algae and cyanobacteria grow 20 times faster than <br>
            land crops (e.g. corn, soybean), able to grow on salt water, able to fix nitrogen <br>
            in air and waste water (e.g. pee) into fertilizer and algae can grow at unfarmable <br>
            lands such as desert. A land with the size of texas would be more than enough to <br>
            produce enough food for the entire world population. Have the ability to eliminate <br>
            world hunger and save millions of people from dying from hunger.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Houseprinter startup project</h2>
        <p>Houseprinter aim to solve the housing crisis by 3D printing house. Currently, people <br>
            need to spend 20 years of time to pay back their mortgage which is terrible <br>

        </p>
        
        <h2>Holo startup projects</h2>
        <p>Holo focus on creating holographic display. </p>

        <h2>Self-sustainable habitat charity project</h2>
        <p>
            All of the jobs would be replaced by machine and AI. So instead of worrying about <br>
            jobs being taken by AI, we could turn it into advantage. We would build a self-sustaining <br>
            habitat that grow all the food, manufacture daily necesity and give it to people for free <br>
        </p>

        <h2>DONUT project</h2>
        <p>
            DONUT project aim to create a solar system sized particle accelerator to test quantum gravity.<br>
            It will uncover the mystery of qunatum gravity, pave the way to the theory of everything and <br>
            lay the scientific foundation to many awesome technology such as wormhole communication, warp <br>
            drive, teleportation, time travel, infinite energy from black hole and many technology that is <br>
            out of our current imagination.
        </p>

        <h2>SHIT project</h2>
        <p>
            Solar Hundred Interplanetary Telescope (SHIT) project aimed to launch 100 telescope, each of a <br>
            diameter of 100 meter wide orbiting around the sun. By combining the data from 100 telescopes, <br>
            we could create a telescope with the disk size of the solar system. This would uncover the mystery <br>
            of how the universe is formed.
